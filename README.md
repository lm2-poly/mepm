## Context
A model to predict the required pressure to apply for Direct-Ink-Writing of non-Newtonian polymer material through a single or multinozzle printing device following the input of a desired printing speed (i.e., linear extrusion velocity) of the material exiting the nozzle(s).

## Publication

## Future work
We are looking for someone to convert the code from Matlab to Python in order to combine the MEPM to the Multinozzle Toolpath Generator (MTG). Contact us if you are interested.
